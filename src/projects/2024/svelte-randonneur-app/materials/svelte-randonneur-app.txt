The main purpose of the application is to edit data processing descriptions.

Prompt:

Please provide a description of the web application  for my portfolio page.
I created recently the application recently for my partner and want to show its features and my skills.

In total, ask me four to six distinct questions to gather information about the application and to learn about my strengths what I can to show on my page.

GPT: Absolutely, let's get started! Here are the first two questions:

1. What is the primary purpose of the web application you created for your partner?

2. What specific technologies and tools did you use to develop this application?

---

The application is designed to view and modify data describing the changes that will be applied to environmental sustainability processes. It should use graphical user-friendly interface to navigate and change different types of data.

There allowed a few types of operations, which could be described by different tables:

- Create datasets
- Delete
- Disaggregate
- Mapping
- Replace
- Update

The user could edit this data separately in the form of tables, where each row represented a data object.

A set of editable metadata properties was also available.

I used the following technologies:

- Svelte -- Front-end software framework.
- SvelteUI -- An UI kit library.
- Svelte Headless Table -- Modified table manipulation library.

GPT: Great, let's continue with the next two questions:

3. Can you describe any unique challenges you faced during the development of this application and how you overcame them?

4. How does your application ensure data accuracy and integrity when users are modifying the environmental sustainability data?

---

It was necessary to create a user-friendly data editing interface that allows the user to work with various data objects and entities: nested objects, selectors (for categorical data such as units and categories) and plain data entries.

We had to change the table manipulation library to support SSR mode, allow multi-level data identifiers (for rows representing nested objects) and provide more detailed information about the data through the API to implement more correct pagination.

We have implemented various types of data filtering: raw text and categorical filters. It was possible to apply several filters at the same time.

The user could upload both his own data and use predefined demo/test datasets.

The user must be able to export the modified data in json format.

---

GPT: 5. How did you ensure the application is scalable and can handle a growing amount of data and users?

To ensure the application is scalable, we focused on optimizing the front-end performance. Using Svelte, we created a highly efficient and responsive user interface. The application employs techniques like efficient pagination to manage large datasets smoothly. By modifying the Svelte Headless Table library, we could support multi-level data identifiers and provide a robust API, which allowed for more detailed and accurate pagination. These optimizations ensure the application can handle increasing amounts of data and users without compromising performance.

GPT: 6. Can you describe any potential improvements or future features you plan to implement based on your initial development experience?

Based on the initial development experience, we plan to implement several future improvements to enhance the application further. One of the key areas is the user interface; we aim to add more customization options and advanced filtering capabilities to make data manipulation even more intuitive.

Additionally, we plan to incorporate different operation types, to allow data objects to be arrays.

Another potential improvement is to improve mobile UX.

These enhancements will ensure the application remains versatile and user-friendly as it evolves.

Final description:

Web Application for Environmental Sustainability Data Management

This web application is designed to view and modify data describing changes that will be applied to environmental sustainability processes. It features a graphical, user-friendly interface to navigate and change different types of data. Users can perform various operations, such as creating datasets, deleting entries, disaggregating data, mapping, replacing, and updating information.

## Technologies Used:

- Svelte: A front-end software framework that provides a highly efficient and responsive user interface.
- SvelteUI: A UI kit library for a consistent and visually appealing design.
- Svelte Headless Table: A modified table manipulation library supporting server-side rendering, multi-level data identifiers, and detailed data pagination.

## Scalability:

We focused on optimizing front-end performance to ensure scalability. The application employs efficient pagination techniques to manage large datasets smoothly. By modifying the Svelte Headless Table library, we supported multi-level data identifiers and provided a robust API for accurate pagination. These optimizations ensure the application can handle increasing amounts of data and users without compromising performance.

## Future Improvements:

Based on the initial development experience, we plan to implement several enhancements:

- Adding more customization options and advanced filtering capabilities to make data manipulation more intuitive.
- Incorporating different operation types to allow data objects to be arrays.
- Improving the mobile user experience (UX) to ensure versatility and user-friendliness as the application evolves.
