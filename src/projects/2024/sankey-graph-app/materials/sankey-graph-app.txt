Prompt:

Please provide a description of the web application for my portfolio page based on its features and purpose.

The purpose:

This application is designed to visualize data flows using sankey diagrams.

The features are:

- Various methods of data loading: (1) programmatically from external data files using URL parameters, (2) uploading user data from a local disk, (3) using a predefined demo dataset.
- Relayout of diagram nodes (provided by the charting library from the box).
- A help reference in a popup window.
- A live visualization server (in python and node js implementations) that allows you to visualize data using external requests and redirects.
- Side panels with applicaiton settings (at left) and selceted node properties (at right).
- Inter-session settings save.
- The settings include: choosing a dark/light theme, a horizontal/vertical layout.
- Automatic/manual hiding of nodes.
- Different node color modes: monochrome, random color, gradient (progressive) colors.
- The ability to manually select colors for specific nodes.

If it's required, feel free to ask me a few distinct questions to gather missed information about the application to make an impressive description.
