My name is Igor and I'm a professional front-end developer with 8 years of experience, recently specializing mainly in React, NextJS, NodeJS and Python (with Flask and Django).

## Brief background

I've been involved in creating various types of web applications and sites: from complex dynamic web applications (sometimes with a backend) to static landing pages, developing applications for embedded browsers (below ES5) and vanilla JS, creating ui kits, reusable libraries, and optimizing performance across a variety of devices and browsers, always creating responsive and adaptive layouts by default (on the principle of "mobile first") -- as an independent developer, and as a part of various teams.

## Techs

My current stack for the frontend is React/NextJS (via MobX or Redux) with TypeScript (previously I used i-Bem/Bem-XJST/ENB/Borschik/jQuery stack, and still fond of it). For static pages/sites I use 11ty generator.

For the backend, I use Python (with Flask or Django) or NodeJS (with Express, for a little simpler tasks), some time ago I used PHP (and still use it for inherited projects). (And once upon a time, at the very beginning of my career, I also used Perl.)

I use SCSS, PostCSS (previously it was LESS and Stylus), mostly with MIU library (sometimes with ChakraUI, Tailwind CSS, or Bootstrap) for UI development. I also use Storybook for large complex projects.

## Other info

I'm currently in GMT+5, but to move to GMT+2 (or GMT+3) soon. I'm mostly looking for a remote job, but I'm also ready to move to switch to an on-site/hybrid job. My English language proficiency is Intermediate or Upper-Intermediate (approx. at B2 CEFR level).

## For HR/potential employers

I'm really looking for an interesting new job right now. At the moment, I'm only considering options with remote work or relocation.
